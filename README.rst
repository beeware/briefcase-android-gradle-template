Briefcase Android Gradle Template
=================================

A `Cookiecutter <https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter/>`__ template for
building Python apps that will run under Android.

**This repository branch contains a template for Python 3.8**.
Other Python versions are available by cloning other branches of repository.

Using this template
-------------------

The easiest way to use this project is to not use it at all - at least, not
directly. `Briefcase <https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/>`__ is a tool that
uses this template, rolling it out using data extracted from a
``pyproject.toml`` configuration file.

However, if you *do* want use this template directly...

1. Install `cookiecutter`_. This is a tool used to bootstrap complex project
   templates::

    $ pip install cookiecutter

2. Run ``cookiecutter`` on the template::

    $ cookiecutter https://github.com/beeware/briefcase-android-gradle-template --checkout 3.8

   This will ask you for a number of details of your application, including the
   `name` of your application (which should be a valid PyPI identifier), and
   the `Formal Name` of your application (the full name you use to describe
   your app). The remainder of these instructions will assume a `name` of
   ``my-project``, and a formal name of ``My Project``.

3. `Download the Python support package for Android`_, and extract it into
   the ``My Project`` directory generated by the template. This will create
   ``app/libs`` and ``app/src/main/assets`` folders containing a self contained
   Python install.

   Alternatively, you can download the `Python-Android-support`_ project, and
   build your own version.

4. Add your code to the template, into the
   ``My Project/app/src/main/assets/python/app`` directory. At the very minimum,
   you need to have an
   ``My Project/app/src/main/assets/python/app/<app name>/__main__.py`` file
   that instantiates an instance of ``org.beeware.android.IPythonApp``, and
   then invokes ``org.beeware.android.MainActivity.setPythonApp()``, providing
   the ``IPythonApp`` instance.

   If your code has any dependencies, they should be installed into the
   ``My Project/app/src/main/assets/python/app_packages`` directory.

If you've done this correctly, a project with a formal name of ``My Project``,
with an app name of ``my-project`` should have a directory structure that
looks something like::

    My Project/
        app/
            src/
                main/
                    assets/
                        python/
                            app/
                                my_project/
                                    __init__.py
                                    __main__.py (declares IPythonApp)
                            app_packages/
                                ...
                cpp/
                    ...
                java/
                    ...
                res/
                    ...
                AndroidManifest.xml
            build.gradle
            proguard-rules.pro
        briefcase.toml
        build.gradle
        gradle.properties
        gradlew
        gradlew.bat
        settings.gradle

You're now ready to run build and run your project! Set

    $ ./gradlew installDebug

Next steps
----------

Of course, running Python code isn't very interesting by itself - you'll be
able to output to the console, and see that output in Gradle, but if you tap the
app icon on your phone, you won't see anything - because there isn't a visible
console on an Android.

To do something interesting, you'll need to work with the native Android system
libraries to draw widgets and respond to screen taps. The `Rubicon`_ Java
bridging library can be used to interface with the Android system libraries.
Alternatively, you could use a cross-platform widget toolkit that supports
Android (such as `Toga`_) to provide a GUI for your application.

Regardless of whether you use Toga, or you write an application natively, the
template project will run the `__main__` module associated with the app name
that you provided when you generated the tempalte. That Python code must
define an instance of ``org.beeware.android.IPythonApp``, and invoke
``org.beeware.android.MainActivity.setPythonApp()`` to set that instance as the
active Python app. This app will coordinate provides the hooks into the
Android application lifecycle (``onCreate``, ``onResume`` and so on); it's
up to you what your code does with those lifecycle hooks. If ``setPythonApp``
is not set, an error will be logged, and the Python interpreter will be shut
down.

If you have any external library dependencies (like Toga, or anything other
third-party library), you should install the library code into the
``app_packages`` directory. This directory is the same as a  ``site_packages``
directory on a desktop Python install.
